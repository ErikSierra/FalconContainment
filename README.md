## Overview ðŸ”Ž
This project leverages the CrowdStrike Falcon API to automate the containment process for a specified list of hosts, with the aim of simplifying security operations.

## Navigation ðŸ”Ž
- **[FalconTests](./FalconTests)**
     - Scripts used for testing/simulating processes of the project
- **[Contain_Host](./Contain_Host)**
     - Scripts used to contain, check containment status, or lift containment on individual hosts
- **[Contain_Group](./Contain_Group)**
     - Scripts used to contain or lift containment on multiple hosts in a group

## Prerequisites ðŸ”Ž

1. Before using these scripts, ensure you have:
- Python 3.6 or higher installed.
- `pip` (Python package installer) installed. You can install it from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

2. Install the required Python packages listed in the respective requirements.txt file
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Obtaining API Credentials
- Before using the CrowdStrike API, you will need to obtain your client ID and client secret.
- These can be obtained by logging into the CrowdStrike Falcon console and going to System Management > API Clients, then creating a new API client. You will be provided with the client ID and client secret.
- Insert these credentials into the config.yaml files where needed (More info in sub folders)



## Notes ðŸ”Ž

#### Consider (where necessary):
- Make sure you have a valid credentials for the CrowdStrike API, as you will need to provide them in the configuration file (.yaml).
- Make sure you provide the correct file path for the (computers.txt) file containing the hostnames, as it is required for the program to process the hosts.
- Review the configuration file to ensure that it contains the right information, including the client ID and client secret, which are required for authentication to the API.
- Review the limitations of the API, which may affect the success rate of containing hosts.
- Keep an eye on the overall status of containment, as well as the status of individual hosts, in your Crowdstrike tool and script's output.
  
#### Error Handling
The scripts include basic error handling to manage issues such as:
- Checking if the configuration file exists and can be read.
- Checking if the file containing the hostnames exists and can be read.
- Checking if the configuration file contains the necessary information for connecting to the CrowdStrike API.
- Checking if the connection to the CrowdStrike API is successful.
- Handling of API errors and exceptions that may occur during the connection and containment process.
- Differentiating between different HTTP response codes and errors returned by the CrowdStrike API and categorizing them as either successful, pending, or failed to contain a host.
- Printing informative error messages for easy debugging.
